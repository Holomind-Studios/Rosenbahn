The Eisenrose wanders through the eternal night, always looking for the next stop. 
The machine's hungry engines ran out of blood. And without blood, the trails of roses fall asleep, leaving only those empty beings that crawl in the shadows. 
Isenrose demands a hunt, a sacrifice and blood... Feed the iron beast so that the future is where your goal awaits.
